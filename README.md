# React Native Redux Starter
Use the code in this repo to quickly set up a project with react native and redux.
This project contains the very basic boilerplate and not much more so its very flexible!

# Get started

In the directory you want to create the RN project

    $ react-native init <project name>
    $ cd <project name>
    $ npm install # install the initial react native dependencies
    $ npm install --save redux # install redux
    $ # (optional) install two very common and handy redux addons
    $ npm install --save redux-logger redux-thunk
    # install code push. This starter has codepush set up in for distributing builds. If you don't want this it's easy to remove from the project
    $ npm install --save react-native-code-push
    $ # (optional) I use lodash in every project nowadays so I always do this before I start :)
    $ npm install --save lodash

Now copy the contents of the rn-redux-starter directory into the project directory and get to coding in the `./src` directory!
